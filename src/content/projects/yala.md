Yala was a Slack integration and web app for social posting and branded custom image/video composition. As CTO, I built the initial app from the ground up, hired and managed the development team, and also performed all DevOps work. Notable features included an in-browser composer for custom images and stop-motion videos and a system to analyze engagement performance to build an ideal posting schedule. You can see some of Yala in action in a demo video <a href="https://vimeo.com/432151258" target="_blank">over here</a>.
