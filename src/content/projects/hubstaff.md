I worked with Hubstaff on a part-time basis to consult on their migration to Vue.js. I established and enforced development standards and helped mentor their existing team of developers as they acclimated to the Vue ecosystem. Other work included implementation of new interactive charts and visualizations with Vue and d3 as well as backend Rails work.
